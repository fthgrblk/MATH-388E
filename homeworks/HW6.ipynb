    "## EMNIST Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "[EMNIST dataset](https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/image-group/emnist-dataset) is a set of hand-written characters and digits. Each of the data points is a grayscale image of size 28x28 pixels.  The structure of the dataset is the same as the infamous [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) dataset, but this dataset contains more samples and also contains characters. You can find more information on the dataset in the paper available at [https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05373v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.05373v1)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the dataset you need [at this link](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/vgap8ici7xs5w7f/AACE-9RrDpbGCc6bP72gHRfUa?dl=0).  Please download and use your local copy to do the homework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Ingest the data (both the train and test sets) into this pyhthon notebook as a numpy array.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a convolutional artifial neural network model, train it and test it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You need to document each of your steps in both the ingestion phase and processing phase: explain the steps taken, the problems you encounter, how you solved them.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. DO NOT write python classes.  In other words, I do not want to see `__init__` or `__main__` in your code.  They are hard to follow (as they contain mutable state) and hard to port to future code you might write on a similar project.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When you upload your solution to github, DO NOT include the datasets. They are large and I already have copies. I can test your models on the copy I have."
